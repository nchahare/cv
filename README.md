## üë®‚Äçüíª Research experience

### PhD student, Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, and UPC

Adviser: **Prof. Xavier Trepat** and **Prof. Marino Arroyo**, Aug 2017‚ÄìPresent

Thesis: **Mechanics of epithelial layers subjected to controlled pressure and tension**

- Designing a device to simulate physiological environment of morphogenesis and epithelial folding, which involves stretching and buckling of epithelia.
- Microfluidic chip to control epithelial shapes and pressure.
- Working on a project in collaboration with **Prof. Pere Roca-Cusachs** for analysing atomic force microscopy data to understand role of force loading rates in cell mechanosensing.
- Constructing a numerical framework to elucidate protein transport with Fluorescence recovery afterphotobleaching (FRAP) and Fluorescence Loss in Photobleaching (FLIP) with Ion Andreu.


### Project Associate, Biomechanics Lab, Indian Institute of Science

Adviser: **Prof. Namrata Gundiah**, July 2016‚ÄìMarch 2017

**Developing constitutive model of Fiber Reinforced Elastomers (FRE)**

- Computed stresses and strains from uniaxial and biaxial stretching experiments of Polydimethylsiloxane Fibre Reinforced Elastomer. Also, modeled experimental results using constrained optimization techniques.
- Computed stresses and strains from uniaxial and biaxial stretching experiments of Polydimethylsiloxane Fibre Reinforced Elastomer. Also, modeled experimental results usingconstrained optimization techniques.


### Masters, Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Science

Adviser: **Prof. Namrata Gundiah**, August 2014‚ÄìJune 2016

Thesis: **Design and fabrication of miniature shear device for cell mechanics**

- Designed a cost effective system capable of applying uniform shear on culture cells along with real time visualization using fluorescence microscopy (microscope mountable).
- Calibrated the device using fluorescence microscopy and traction force microscopy to test for uniform shear flow conditions. Implemented trajectory generation filter based control system in the shear device electronics using MATLAB and Arduino programming

**Finite element analysis of coffee white stem borer (CWSB) mandible**

- Created geometry of insect mandible from tomography data using image processing and CAD modeling.
- Stress and displacement distribution on mandible during wood boring were computed using commercial FEA package, ABAQUS.
- Stresses on the mandible were used to examine the morphological adaptations that provide distinct mechanical advantages to the insect for cutting purposes.

### Undergraduate, Mechanical Engineering, VNIT

Adviser: **Prof. Pramod Padole**, May 2013--April 2014

Thesis: **Design and Fabrication of a Hirda (Terminalia chebula) Cracking Machine**

- The project involved solving problem of Indian tribal population dealing with processing of hirda fruit for medicinal applications.
- Built a machine to separate seed from the fruit called ``Hirda'', by crushing the fruit between two rollers. Use of machine led to lower processing time, higher output and minimal manual labour.
